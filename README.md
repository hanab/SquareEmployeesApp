# SquareEmployeesApp

## Introduction

The application lists employees form the end point given in a UITableView.  
I created the project using XCode v 11.6 but I have done most of the development using Xcode v 12.2 since I upgraded my machine. And Project target is iOS 13.0 or later

## FrameWorks Used
No third party library is used
URLSession is used for Networking
Codable is used for Json parsing
XCTest is used for Testing

## Focus Area
I tried to do a little bit of everything in general. so my focus was on building an app which looks reasonable good and functions as expected. But If I have to say one thing I focused on architecting the app so that it is more testable.I used protocol oriented programming on some parts to make the code more testable.

## How to Run it
Open the Xcode project file and connect a device or simulator with iOS 13.0 or later and press the run button
The application works in both landscape and portarite mode
